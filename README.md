# hello-world

Hello GitHub!

I'm Marco, I like learn and improve my skills in programming-languages (such as C/C++, Python, Javascript, Java ecc.) or even learn new ones! Also I love draw and create graphics for my projects (using Illustrator, GIMP ecc.).


And I like pizza \(OoO)/


Peace.


I can find bugs everywhere, even in snack dispensers (._.)
